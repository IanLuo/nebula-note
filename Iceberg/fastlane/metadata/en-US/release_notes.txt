After a long process of research, design, development, test, x3 note finally make it's 1.0 milestone. while holding the phone in my hand and using it, it feels so good, not because it is working, but it really help me with my work, while developing, I keep using x3 note to track my work, make plans and write notes, as the process of development and design move farward, it works better and better, and now I hope more people can use it, get along with it, feel the same way as I feel, see the conveniency x3 note can give, keep awesome notes and write great articles. 
Hope you like it.
